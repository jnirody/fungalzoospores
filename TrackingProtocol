Open TrackMate to start segmenting and tracking (Plugins —> Tracking —> TrackMate)
Use Difference of Gaussian (DoG) detector for spot segmentation
You can measure 'Estimated blob diameter' using the line segment tool, but for 20x videos on slides 25 pixels is usually a decent estimate.
A threshold of 1.0 works well for this dataset, but use the 'Preview' option to make sure. Remember that it is better to over-detect than under-detect.
Note: the initial segmentation can take some time after you press 'Next'.
You can make adjustments and filter spots in the ‘Initial Thresholding’ step, but it's not necessary — it's easy enough to do it in the step where you manually edit the tracks.
Use the 'Hyperstack Displayer' setting.
Use the 'LAP Tracker'.
Use the 'TrackScheme' to manually quality control the tracks. Merge tracks that were not automatically merged in prior steps, and remove extraneous points. In the end, what should remain is a single track for each cell, with only one spot per frame; some frames might be skipped but if there is too big a gap, just trim the trace.

Export the COM data using the 'Analysis' button and save the 'Spot Analysis' file as a .csv (File —> Save As) in the folder corresponding to the right species within the directory ‘/Users/jnirody/Dropbox/Research/Projects/unicellular eukaryotes/zoospores’
